# Tennis Match Outcome Predictor
Using a Linear Regression model to try to predict the number of wins a tennis player will have based on the number of break point opportunities they get in a game

# Features
Load and process a dataset from a CSV file.
Visualize the dataset using scatter plots, histograms, and QQ plots.
Implement a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.
Evaluate model performance using R-squared scores.
Perform residual analysis.

# Libraries Used
pandas: Data loading and manipulation.
numpy: Numerical calculations.
matplotlib: Data visualization.
sklearn: Machine learning model creation, training, and testing.

# Dataset Description
The 'tennis_stats.csv' file contains numerous tennis statistics such as service game stats, return game stats, and match outcomes, which includes player name, year of the record, aces, double faults, first serves, first serve points won, second serve points won, break points faced, break points saved, service games played, service games won, total service points won, first serve return points won, second serve return points won, break points opportunities, break points converted, return games played, return games won, return points won, total points won, wins, losses, winnings, and ranking.


# Results
The model predicts the number of wins a tennis player will have based on the number of break point opportunities they get in a game.

Please remember that the results depend on the quality of the data you input. More diverse and representative data will likely yield better results.
